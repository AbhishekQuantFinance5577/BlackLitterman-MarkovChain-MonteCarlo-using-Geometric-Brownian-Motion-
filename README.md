# Portfolio-Optimization-and-MCMC-using-Geometric-Brownian-Motion-
This project involves optimizing portfolios and simulating prices for stocks, cryptos using Python. I calculated optimal portfolio weights to minimize variance and maximize returns, used the Black-Litterman model, and plotted results. I also used MCMC to simulate DJIA and crypto returns, analyzing the best samples.
